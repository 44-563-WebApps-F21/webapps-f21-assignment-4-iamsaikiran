    <h5 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>
    <p class="speech allonby">I delight in men over seventy.  They always offer one the
devotion of a lifetime.  I think seventy an ideal age for a man.</p>

<h5 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>
<p class="speech hunstanton">She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn’t she?
By-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more
often now.  You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don’t you?</p>

<h5 class="name">GERALD.</h5>
<p class="speech gerald">I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth’s
secretary.</p>

<h5 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>
<p class="speech hunstanton">Surely not, Gerald!  It would be most unwise of you.
What reason can you have?</p>

<h5 class="name">GERALD.</h5>
<p class="speech gerald">I don’t think I should be suitable for the post.</p>

<h5 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>
<p class="speech allonby">I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary.
But he says I am not serious enough.</p>

<h5 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>
<p class="speech hunstanton">My dear, you really mustn’t talk like that in this
house.  Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn’t know anything about the wicked society in
which we all live.  She won’t go into it.  She is far too good.  I
consider it was a great honour her coming to me last night.  It gave
quite an atmosphere of respectability to the party.</p>

<h5 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>
<p class="speech allonby">Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in
the air.</p>

<h5 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>
<p class="speech hunstanton">My dear, how can you say that?  There is no resemblance
between the two things at all.  But really, Gerald, what do you mean by
not being suitable?</p>

<h5 class="name">GERALD.</h5>
<p class="speech gerald">Lord Illingworth’s views of life and mine are too different.</p>

<h5 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>
<p class="speech hunstanton">But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn’t have any
views of life.  They are quite out of place.  You must be guided by
others in this matter.  Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering
offer, and travelling with him you would see the world—as much of it, at
least, as one should look at—under the best auspices possible, and stay
with all the right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in
your career.</p>

<h5 class="name">GERALD.</h5>
<p class="speech gerald">I don’t want to see the world: I’ve seen enough of it.</p>

<h5 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>
<p class="speech allonby">I hope you don’t think you have exhausted life, Mr.
Arbuthnot.  When a man says that, one knows that life has exhausted him.</p>
