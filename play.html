    <p class="Stage Direction">_Sitting-room at Mrs. Arbuthnot’s_. _Large open French window at back_,
        _looking on to garden_. _Doors_ R.C. _and_ L.C. </p>

        <p class="Stage Direction"> [GERALD ARBUTHNOT _writing at table_.] </p>

        <p class="Stage Direction"> [_Enter_ ALICE R.C. _followed by_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ALLONBY.] </p>

        <p class="Stage Direction"> ALICE. Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby. </p>
    <p>
        <h6 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6> 
        <p class="speech">Well, there _is_ a good deal to be said for blushing,
        if one can do it at the proper moment. Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell
        me I didn’t blush nearly often enough. But then he was so very
        particular. He wouldn’t let me know any of his men friends, except those
        who were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way,
        was brought into the Divorce Court. A most unfortunate case.</p>

        <h6 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY.</h6> 
        <p class="speech"></p>I delight in men over seventy. They always offer one the
        devotion of a lifetime. I think seventy an ideal age for a man.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p class="speech">She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn’t she?
        By-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more
        often now. You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don’t you?</p>

        <h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6>
        <p class="speech">I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth’s
        secretary.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Surely not, Gerald! It would be most unwise of you.
        What reason can you have?</p>

        <h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6>
        <p class="speech">I don’t think I should be suitable for the post.</p>

        <h6 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>
        <p class="speech">I wish Lord Illingworth would ask me to be his secretary.
        But he says I am not serious enough.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p class="speech">My dear, you really mustn’t talk like that in this
        house. Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn’t know anything about the wicked society in
        which we all live. She won’t go into it. She is far too good. I
        consider it was a great honour her coming to me last night. It gave
        quite an atmosphere of respectability to the party.</p>

        <h6 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Ah, that must have been what you thought was thunder in
        the air.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p class="speech">My dear, how can you say that? There is no resemblance
        between the two things at all. But really, Gerald, what do you mean by
        not being suitable?</p>

        <h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Lord Illingworth’s views of life and mine are too different.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p class="speech">But, my dear Gerald, at your age you shouldn’t have any
        views of life. They are quite out of place. You must be guided by
        others in this matter. Lord Illingworth has made you the most flattering
        offer, and travelling with him you would see the world—as much of it, at
        least, as one should look at—under the best auspices possible, and stay
        with all the right people, which is so important at this solemn moment in
        your career.</p>

        <h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6>
        <p class="speech">I don’t want to see the world: I’ve seen enough of it.</p>

        <h6 class="name">MRS. ALLONBY.</h6>
        <p class="speech">I hope you don’t think you have exhausted life, Mr.
        Arbuthnot. When a man says that, one knows that life has exhausted him.</p>

        <h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6>
        <p class="speech">I don’t wish to leave my mother.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Now, Gerald, that is pure laziness on your part. Not
        leave your mother! If I were your mother I would insist on your going.</p>

        <p class="Stage Direction">[_Enter_ ALICE L.C.]</p>

        <h6 class="name">ALICE.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Mrs. Arbuthnot’s compliments, my lady, but she has a bad
        headache, and cannot see any one this morning. [_Exit_ R.C.] </p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p class="speech">[_Rising_.] A bad headache! I am so sorry! Perhaps
        you’ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better,
        Gerald.</p>

        <h6 class="name">GERALD.</h6>
        <p class="speech">I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton.</p>

        <h6 class="name">LADY HUNSTANTON.</h6>
        <p class="speech">Well, to-morrow, then. Ah, if you had a father,
        Gerald, he wouldn’t let you waste your life here. He would send you off
        with Lord Illingworth at once. But mothers are so weak. They give up to
        their sons in everything. We are all heart, all heart. Come, dear, I
        must call at the rectory and inquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid,
        is far from well. It is wonderful how the Archdeacon bears up, quite
        wonderful. He is the most sympathetic of husbands. Quite a model.
        Good-bye, Gerald, give my fondest love to your mother. </p>
